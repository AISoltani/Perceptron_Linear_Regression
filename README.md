## Perceptron_Linear_Regression

This repository contains an implementation of linear regression using the perceptron algorithm. The perceptron algorithm is a simple and widely used algorithm for binary classification tasks. In this case, we adapt it for linear regression, which is a supervised learning technique for predicting continuous values.

Prerequisites
To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
NumPy (version 1.16 or higher)
Matplotlib (version 3.0 or higher)
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Perceptron_Linear_Regression.git
```

Navigate to the repository's directory:

Copy
cd Perceptron_Linear_Regression
```

Install the required Python packages:

basic
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Usage
To use the perceptron linear regression implementation, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset: Make sure you have a dataset in a suitable format for linear regression. The dataset should consist of input features and corresponding target values.

Adjust the hyperparameters: Open the perceptron_linear_regression.py file and modify the hyperparameters as needed. The hyperparameters include the learning rate, number of epochs, and the threshold for the perceptron algorithm. Adjust these values based on your dataset and desired model performance.

Run the script: Execute the perceptron_linear_regression.py script to train the model on your dataset and obtain predictions. The script will output the trained model's coefficients, the mean squared error, and a scatter plot comparing the predicted values against the ground truth values.

Copy
python perceptron_linear_regression.py
```

Analyze the results: Examine the scatter plot to visualize the model's predictions and compare them with the ground truth values. Additionally, review the mean squared error as an evaluation metric for the model's performance.
